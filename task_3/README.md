# Housing Price Prediction – Linear Regression (Task 3)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression on the Housing dataset to predict house prices and understand feature relationships using regression modeling and evaluation metrics.

---

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Housing Price Prediction Dataset  

Target Column:
- price

Features include numerical and categorical housing attributes such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, furnishing status, etc.

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded Housing.csv dataset  
2. Checked basic information and missing values  
3. Removed rows with null values  
4. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding  
5. Split data into training and testing sets  
6. Trained Linear Regression model  
7. Generated predictions  
8. Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score  
9. Plotted regression line  
10. Interpreted model coefficients  

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score  

---

## Model Interpretation

Regression coefficients were analyzed to understand how each feature impacts house price.

---

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented Linear Regression on the Housing dataset.  
The model performance was evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R².  
Feature coefficients helped explain the relationship between housing attributes and price.
