# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset to understand data distribution, relationships between features, and survival patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.

---

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Titanic Dataset  

Target Column:
- Survived (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

Key Features:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Fare  
- Pclass  
- Embarked  

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded Titanic-Dataset.csv  
2. Checked basic information and missing values  
3. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
4. Plotted histograms for Age and Fare  
5. Visualized outliers using boxplots  
6. Analyzed survival distribution using countplots  
7. Studied Gender vs Survival  
8. Created correlation heatmap  
9. Generated pairplot for key features  
10. Identified patterns and trends

## Visualizations Included

- Histograms (Age, Fare)  
- Boxplots  
- Survival Count Plot  
- Gender vs Survival Plot  
- Correlation Matrix Heatmap  
- Pairplot (Survived, Age, Fare, Pclass)  

---

## Key Observations

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.  
- Passengers with higher fares showed better survival probability.  
- Pclass is strongly related to survival.  
- Age has moderate influence on survival outcomes.  

---

## Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis provided valuable insights into passenger survival patterns and feature relationships. These findings help guide feature selection and model building in later machine learning stages.
