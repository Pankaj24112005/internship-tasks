# Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic Survival Dataset to prepare it for machine learning tasks.

This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, visualizing outliers, and standardizing numerical features.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Titanic Dataset  

Target Column:
- Survived (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

Features include:
- Age
- Sex
- Fare
- Pclass
- Embarked
- SibSp
- Parch

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded Titanic-Dataset.csv  
2. Checked data types and missing values  
3. Handled missing values using median and mode  
4. Removed irrelevant columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)  
5. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding  
6. Visualized outliers using boxplot  
7. Standardized numerical columns (Age, Fare)  
8. Generated final cleaned dataset

## Techniques Applied

- Missing value imputation  
- One-hot encoding  
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)  
- Outlier visualization  
- Data preprocessing for ML readiness  

---

## Outcome

The dataset is now clean, structured, and ready for machine learning model training.
