# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees & Random Forests

##  Project Overview

This project is part of **Task 5 – Decision Trees and Random Forests**.  
The objective is to understand tree-based machine learning models and apply them to predict heart disease using a real-world dataset.

We use the **Heart Disease Dataset** and implement:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Overfitting analysis
- Feature importance
- Cross-validation

---

## Objectives

- Train a Decision Tree and visualize its behavior
- Analyze overfitting by controlling tree depth
- Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy
- Interpret feature importance
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset (download from Kaggle):

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

Rename the downloaded CSV file as:
heart.csv


Place it in the same directory as the notebook.

---

## Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train Decision Tree model
4. Analyze overfitting using different max_depth values
5. Train Random Forest model
6. Compare accuracies
7. Visualize feature importance
8. Perform cross-validation
9. Draw conclusions

---

## Results

- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than Decision Tree.
- Decision Tree showed overfitting at higher depths.
- Feature importance revealed key medical parameters affecting heart disease.
- Cross-validation confirmed Random Forest stability.

---

## Conclusion

Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree due to ensemble learning (bagging).  
It provides better generalization and robustness, making it more suitable for heart disease prediction.
